	abstract = "This paper proposes a novel evolutionary algorithm to handle the colorful traveling salesman problem. The proposed evolutionary algorithm is a three-phase algorithm and utilizes two types of a new crossover and an enhanced local search. In the first phase, quality of population is increased by applying the first crossover. After the first phase, a priority value is computed to each color, based on the best tour of the first phase. During the second phase, priority values are updated when a solution with better cost than existing solutions in population is found. Priority values are used by the second type of crossover, which is used in the second phase. After the second phase, the problem is converted to the classical traveling salesman problem ingeniously, and finally, the third phase is a hybrid genetic algorithm, for which an enhanced local search algorithm is applied. Applying the second type of crossover and updating priority values are continued in the third phase. The proposed algorithm is effective and finds new bounds for many large-scale instances and outperforms other state-of-the-art heuristic in terms of accuracy and speed. In many cases, gaps between results obtained by the proposed algorithm and the other methods are high. For some large-scale instances, proposed algorithm is 44 times faster than the other state-of-the-art competitor, which is the current most efficient algorithm."

	abstract = {This paper presents a real-world case study of optimizing waste collection in Sweden. The problem, involving approximately 17,000 garbage bins served by three bin lorries, is approached as a travelling salesman problem and solved using simulation-based optimization and an evolutionary algorithm. To improve the performance of the evolutionary algorithm, it is enhanced with a repair function that adjusts its genome values so that shorter routes are found more quickly. The algorithm is tested using two crossover operators, i.e., the order crossover and heuristic crossover, combined with different mutation rates. The results indicate that the order crossover is superior to the heuristics crossover, but that the driving force of the search process is the mutation operator combined with the repair function.},

	abstract = {The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a famous NP-hard problem. The established evolutionary algorithms (EAs) cannot get satisfactory solutions of large or even medium scale TSP instances. To change this situation, a effective EA based on inver-over operator is introduced. In this algorithm, two novel crossover operators, the segment replacing crossover and the order adjusting crossover, are proposed. Moreover, a mechanism for changing the crossover and the mutation rate of the inver-over operator according to generations and a parameter, the critical value, is employed. The results of the experiment show that this new algorithm outperforms the basic EA based on the inver-over operator in all the 4 instances.},
