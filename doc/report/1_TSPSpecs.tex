Wolfram MathWorld defines the travelling salesman problem as ``a problem 
in graph theory requiring the most efficient (\ie least total distance) 
Hamiltonian cycle a salesman can take through each of $n$ cities,'' for which
``no general method of solution is known.'' \cite{tsp_wolfram_alpha} The 
website also remarks that the problem is assigned to the class of NP-hard 
(non-deterministic polynomial time) problems.

Given three datasets, for territories Western Sahara, Uruguay, and Canada of 
size $29$, $734$, and $4,663$ cities, respectively, the objective has been 
to design a genetic algorithm from scratch in the Python programming language
to solve the TSP for each locale using some advanced technique(s).

The first advanced technique employed in the algorithm is the {\em inver-over}
hybrid crossover/mutation operator.
