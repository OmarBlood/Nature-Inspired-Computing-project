The GA run on the Western Sahara dataset took less than 
500 generations to plateau and get stuck at a local minima, 
indicating that the algorithm had reached the best possible 
fitness (i.e solution) it can create. 

Unlike Western Sahara, Uruguay took around 4000 generations 
to reach a local minima and start plateauing. The larger 
dataset allowed the algorithm more freedom to work with and 
further randomize the candidate solutions in each generation 
to avoid getting stuck in local minima. 

Lastly, the Canada dataset did run successfully, but due to 
hardware limitations it encountered memory errors while running 
halfway through the 5000-generation limit. Therefore, had there 
been access to better equipment, the dataset would run and 
generate the data adequaetly.
