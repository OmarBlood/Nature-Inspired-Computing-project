%% BREAK LINES EVERY 80 CHARACTERS TO HELP GIT WITH MERGING
Before any benchmarking was done, an effort was made to use the 
NumPy \cite{numpy} module's interfaces as much as possible over raw 
Python data types. For example, when possible |numpy.ndarray| was 
chosen over Python's |list| data structure. The SciPy\footnote{NumPy is
part of the SciPy Stack.} documentation states:
\begin{quote}
	 \ldots the fact that [Python |list|s] can contain objects of differing 
	 types mean that Python must store type information for every 
	 element, and must execute type dispatching code when operating 
	 on each element. This also means that very few list operations can 
	 be carried out by efficient C loops --- each iteration would require 
	 type checks and other Python API bookkeeping. \cite{scipy_docs}
\end{quote}
As the problem being solved requires extensive accessing and mutating
of arrays containing a single data type (\ie real numbers), NumPy 
provided a very easily-implemented speed boost.
