%% BREAK LINES EVERY 80 CHARACTERS TO HELP GIT WITH MERGING
In summation, our genetic algorithm has proved to be feasible 
in terms of obtaining a solution to the TSP, based on extensive 
testing with the given data. The inver-over operator was utilized 
as our crossover method, and a combination of swap and scramble 
for our mutation operators; both initialized in such a way that 
our GA would accordingly increase or decrease the chances of 
either happening, should it detect that our solutions were 
getting stuck at a local minima with each subsequent generation.
