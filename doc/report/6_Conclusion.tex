%% BREAK LINES EVERY 80 CHARACTERS TO HELP GIT WITH MERGING
In summation, our genetic algorithm has proved to be feasible 
in terms of obtaining a solution to the TSP, based on extensive 
testing with the given data. The inver-over operator was utilized 
as our crossover method, and a combination of swap and scramble 
for our mutation operators; both initialized in such a way that 
our GA would accordingly increase or decrease the chances of 
either happening, should it detect that our solutions were 
getting stuck at a local minima with each subsequent generation.
According to the graphs illustrated in the results section, 
it can be concluded that using the GA techniques discussed 
throughout the report causes the population of candidate 
solutions to plateau quicker in smaller datasets. 
Furthermore, due to the large number of generations, 
the algorithm was able to properly explore and exploit 
its population in order to reach the best possible fitness.
For our algorithm to run as effectively and efficiently, 
several optimization methods had to be implemented, 
from the implementation of NumPy arrays and multi-threaded processing, 
to cheaply computing the distance for each candidate in each 
generation and precomputing them all at once.
